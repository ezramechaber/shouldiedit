          <p>Okay, so you're a public figure, or maybe you work for a big brand. And you figure you'll go to Wikipedia to check out what the article about you says.</p>

          <p>And you look, and you realize something is totally inaccurateâ€”or worse, unflattering! And so you say to yourself, <em>"I'm just going to fix it."</em></p>

          <p><strong>STOP. That's a bad idea.</strong></p>

          <h3>Why shouldn't I edit my own Wikipedia page?</h3>
          <p>Well... editing your own Wikipedia page is a conflict of interest.</p>
          <p>Wikipedia's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Policies_and_guidelines">own policies and guidelines</a> have a comprehensive section on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Conflict_of_interest">Wikipedia conflicts of interests</a>:
          <blockquote><p>Conflict of interest (COI) editing involves contributing to Wikipedia about yourself, family, friends, clients, employers, or your financial and other relationships. Any external relationship can trigger a conflict of interest. That someone has a conflict of interest is a description of a situation, not a judgment about that person's opinions or integrity.</p>
          <p>COI editing is strongly discouraged on Wikipedia. It undermines public confidence, and it risks causing public embarrassment to the individuals being promoted. Editors with a COI cannot know whether or how much it has influenced their editing. If COI editing causes disruption, an administrator may opt to place blocks on the involved accounts.</p></blockquote>
          <p>Wikipedia is one of the most expansive online resources of knowledge and while it's far from perfect, we all benefit from articles that are writen by impartial observers.</p>

          <h3>But I thought anyone could edit Wikipedia?</h3>
          <p>Yes, anyone <em>can</em> edit Wikipedia. It's what makes it great! In fact, every once in a while, <a href="http://nymag.com/selectall/2017/01/wikipedia-invertebrate-page-edited-to-include-paul-ryan.html">some charming rogue adds Paul Ryan to a list of invertebrates</a>. It definitely doesn't fall within the Wikipedia guidelines, but damn if it isn't funny.</p>

          <h3>Okay, so I don't care about the guidelines or ethics. What's stopping me?</h3>
          <p>Leaving aside the clear conflict of interest (that you're <em>supposed</em> to be disclosing if you edit), your edit will be reviewed by a team of editors on the site, and every edit you make is publicly logged.</p>
          <p>Your IP address and other information about you may wind up public, and... you just might get caught.</p> 
          <p><strong>Think it can't happen to you?</strong></p>
          <p>Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-of-interest_editing_on_Wikipedia">keeps a list</a> of all the people who have been caught self-editing -- including the founder of Wikipedia Jimmy Wales!

          <p><strong>There's even a Twitter account that tracks every edit made by U.S. Congressional staffers:</strong></p>

          <h3>Okay, but something is <em>wrong</em> about me on the internet. How do I fix it?</h3>
          <p>Ach, that's the worst! Okay here are a few things you can do:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Edit openly:</strong> Okay, if you absolutely have to edit your Wikipedia page, do it <em>openly</em>. Say who you are, back up your sources, and be ready to engage in the Talk section of your article. But be prepared for community editors to reject your edits, especially if they're subjective or tonal edits.</li>
            <li><strong>Hire an editor:</strong> If you want to put a little more distance between you and your editing, you can commission a Wikipedia editor to update your page. Wikipedia gets a little fuzzy about this so if you want to go this route, you're on your own.</li>
            <li><strong>Talk it out:</strong> Okay, so you aren't going to edit your wikipedia page yourself, and you don't want to hire an editor. But you can open a discussion in the Talk section of the article, providing sources you have and ask contributors to consider editing.</li>
            <li><strong>Control the rest of your web presence:</strong> You might never be able to directly control your Wikipedia page without incurring the wrath of the editing community, but you can do a number of things to make sure your narrative surfaces on the internet. Create a keyword-friendly website, maintain an active social media presence, and generally populate your search results with the information you'd like your article to reflect. Hell, do interviews with news outlets and talk specifically about the very items you wish were covered in your page.</li></ol>
